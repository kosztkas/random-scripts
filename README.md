## Random scripts that might be useful once again
* Ansible playbooks:
  from here and there
* QuoteParser: creating human readable txt & table from XML vendor quote
* ipinfo: get location information of IP
* insertcoin: Show "INSERT COIN" on HP printers
* Excel VBA stuff: hiding/showing tabs and rows
* Mass deploy linux users with bash script -- should use ansible instead?
