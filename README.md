## Random scripts that might be useful once again
* Ansible playbooks: from here and there
* QuoteParser: creating human readable txt & table from XML vendor quote
* ipinfo: get location information of an IP
* insertcoin: Show "INSERT COIN" ready message on HP printers
* Excel VBA stuff: hiding/showing tabs and rows
* Mass deploy linux users with bash script -- should use ansible instead?
* ASCII to text: excel function to convert a list of ascii codes to string ( `[72 105 33 ] -> Hi!` )
